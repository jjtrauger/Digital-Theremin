# Digital-Theremin
This is an electrical engineering project I designed to create a digital theremin using cheap materials.

Project Code was fully authored by me. Values for time and pitch are mostly arbitrary as it is what I felt sounded best. The pitches.h file is a library translating frequencies to notes, not authored by me. Taught myself to read music so I could create startup song of choice and reasonably set played noted between one octave.
